## About
This repository contains the source code and supporting documentation for the Aqua Garbage Collector (AGC) project as detailed in our associated academic paper. The project aims to leverage cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence models—YOLOv5, NanoDet, and RT-DETR—to detect and classify various types of underwater trash. This initiative seeks to enhance marine ecosystems' health by improving garbage management and cleaning processes through efficient and automated trash capture systems.
